    <p> <b>The girl in her vain dream.</b> <br>
      Young teenage girl Kelden is aware of what grownups are aware of. She was raised by her widowed mother in a tiny village. She lost her father at a crucial time in her life, and after his death, her mother remarried a guy who lived day and night with a bottle of whiskey. She has a younger brother, whom she views as more fortunate than she is. She usually spent her time herding cattle, wandering the forest with them to graze, and gathering firewood for the chilly winter nights. Even yet, her sober stepfather is still making a fuss and threatening the entire family while throwing stuff at her mother, who is an innocent victim.
      It is tough for her to get up early in the morning and start her march to high school while carrying a packed lunch across her back because she has to travel miles to go to the school where she studies.
      Nevertheless, she continues to attend boarding school even when other kids her age are having fun and receiving the best parental guidance. For Kelden, she is consistently ethically responsible and thoughtful, enabling her to manage such a demanding reality while holding a strong urge to learn and escape the ocean of misery. Kelden's motivation to study is boosted by sentiments of her family and how her stepfather devastates them; despite everything, she consistently achieves the highest grade in the class on her yearly exam.
      The school had nothing but praise for a little girl who is ambitious to become  a doctor because of her good behavior and performance. Moreover  she turns into a model student at the school. For Kelden, living in a hostel is the only temple that is truly secure for her to learn and conquer adversities. She always worries about leaving on vacation, despite how much she misses her mother and brother, because of her clumsy stepfather, who yelled at her with his bulging eyeball  almost poking out. Kelden, however, acted as though nothing had occurred and joyfully returned to her village. The excitement was again dashed when she noticed her mother's facial scars and sensed the bad atmosphere coming from her house. She can do nothing but sit in a dark, gloomy corner of her store and cry.
      She is reminded of her earlier days when she used to chase after cattle through bushes that were both thick and thin. She gets up at the crack of dawn to perform her morning household duties, which include preparing the cattle's feast and pouring water into the altar. Her morning routine includes eating breakfast early and running after cattle to ensure that they are returned safely and with enough time to graze in the lush green meadow.Her only neighbor and childhood friend in her village is Pema Zangmo. Given the fact that they are both the same age and in the same grade, she was raised in a comfortable home and attends an urban school. Kelden has always envied her for coming from a wealthy family and having a supporting family.
      She took her cattle to the jungle to graze one nice day as she usually did, but this time she ventured a little more from her usual pasture area. She carried a rope to gather firewood and a meal she had packed. Since Kelden is a fearless little girl, walking alone into the woods is nothing out of the ordinary for her. She is well-versed in wild flora and fauna, thus she could quickly get away from troublesome situations. Kelden was exceptionally uneasy and unaccustomed to the deep forest on that particular day nevertheless. 
      The area is covered in throne chestnut and big, broad oak trees. With no signs of any nearby people, the area seems mysterious and haunted. She continued to be brave enough to herd cattle and gather more firewood. She lost one of her cows, which produced the most milk and was her primary source of income at home, all of a sudden. When she was alarmed, she chased the other cattle in her herd home before going back to look for a missing cow.
      She kept looking for the cow as the sun sank over the crest of the young mountain while drenched in perspiration and gripped by the anxiety that made her the most tense. <br><br>
      Kelden heard a faint mooing in the distance as she looked for her missing cow. She spotted her cow lying on the ground helpless in a tiny clearing after following the noises. She soon noticed that the cow was hurt and required immediate medical care. Without a second thought, Kelden looked at the cow's wounds and noticed a broken leg. She used twigs and branches she had collected from the forest to make a splint for the cow's leg, and then she tied the splint to the leg with her rope.
She discovered that she had become lost in the jungle when she got up to take the cow back home. She didn't know where she was and had no way to get back. Kelden realized she needed to maintain composure and think logically. She waited for darkness to fall and then searched for the North Star, remembering that her mother had taught her how to navigate by the stars. Once she did, she realized she needed to go the other way in order to return home.
They faced numerous obstacles as Kelden and her cow set out on their journey through the forest. It was challenging to move quickly due to the dense foliage, and it was hot and humid, making it challenging to stay cool. In order to avoid getting lost in the thick woods, they had to carefully navigate through rugged terrain and deep ravines. Kelden was fully aware that one false move could mean the end for both her and her cow, and that each step they took seemed to take them more into the unknown.
As Kelden and her cow ventured further into the forest, they came across a large array of wild animals. They had to remain cautious around potentially harmful animals including snakes, boars and big cats. To find suitable places to rest and to find food and water, Kelden had to use her knowledge of the jungle. However, not all of the life in the jungle was friendly. In order to escape dangerous predators, Kelden and her cow had to move continuously and be extra diligent.
One night, while Kelden and her cow were sleeping, a pack of wolves ambushed them. The howls of the wolves Kelden heard in the distance were getting closer and closer. She gathered twigs and branches to make a fire to stave off the wolves since she knew she had to act quickly to save her cow. She used her rope to tie her cow to a nearby tree, and then stood guard with a makeshift spear she had fashioned from a stick and a sharp rock.
Kelden could feel her heart thumping in her chest as the wolves drew nearer. She was prepared for it since she grasped that this was a battle for her life. With their eyes gleaming in the firelight, the wolves were surrounding her and moving closer and closer. In preparation for the attack, Kelden held her ground.
The first wolf lunged at her, and Kelden thrust her spear forward, impaling the wolf on the sharp rock. The other wolves hesitated for a moment, but then they too began to attack. Kelden fought bravely, wielding her spear with skill and precision, but there were too many of them. She was outnumbered and outmatched.
Just as the wolves were closing in for the kill, Kelden heard a loud roar in the distance. She couldn't believe her eyes…….
<br><br>Just as the wolves were closing in for the kill, Kelden heard a loud roar in the distance. She couldn't believe her eye.
A blurry, enormous, fuzzy beast that looked like a chimpanzee approached Kelden, who was scared and stood idle. The wolves that rounded Kelden abruptly bowed their heads, screamed in a sob-like tone, and fled silently. Even though Kelden was quite glad to get rid of the wolves, she was also more terrified this time. With each step closer to her, the sound of the animals' feet intensifies until it resembles that of a huge elephant. She is still numb and has nothing to do. She bravely defended her illed cow from the attack. 
She could see the animal approaching and recognized it as a female bear roaring angrily as though she had lost her cub.
She was silently wondering if it would be their last destination as she glared at her cow in despair. Kelden, however, could not help but think of her grandmother's tale of escaping a bear. She remembered clearly what her grandmother had said: "Whenever we meet a bear in the jungle, avoid running uphills because they have strong grips to climb up and could easily get caught by them." Instead, try running downhill, which will be simpler and make it harder for the bear to control their speed and cause them to land up falling after a speedy run.
After that, she remembered everything, mentally counted to three, gripped the cow's rope tightly, and began sprinting 100 meters across the forest. Despite the challenges, she was keen about saving herself and the cow. The bear that was after them was moving quickly, howling loudest she could, chasing the quiet sleeping birds and rattling the homes of squirrels.
A few meters down, Kelden changed her direction and stealthily hid the cow and herself behind a massive rock. She acknowledges her grandmother's advice and keeps a silent watch on the bear. Fortunately, the bear lost control of its speed and rolled down to a mile distance. She hugged her cow after exhaling deeply for a long time.
Her mother was anxiously awaiting her daughter's arrival back home. She performs a simple ritual and asks the local astrologer to predict Kelden's safe return. The nasty stepfather, on the other hand, was fiercely accusing Kelden for the death of the cow while holding his booze bottle in his hand. He was yelling at her wife for her daughter's failings at home and acting in an aggressive manner.
Kelden's stomach grumbled from two days of starvation. She quickly finds her way back home by using the stars as a guide. Fortunately, after a number of struggles, Kelden managed to locate a portion of her route and hastily returned home.
She couldn't believe her stepfather was waiting for her in an unpleasant manner, though....

 <b>Journey towards east is a fictional journal of her stays at eastern Bhutan.</b> <br><br>

<i>Epi-1</i>
On the 8th day of the fall season, the hot sun beamed overhead with its powerful rays. I had the motivation and stamina to leave my hometown and go such a distance when I woke up. I kept remembering the days of sadness, which left me feeling completely betrayed and heartbroken. Each time the memory occurred to me, it felt like a sharp knife had been poked into my delicate skin. I had just neatly organized my belongings in my baggage and dressed in my dessup uniform.
I took another look at myself in the mirror. I recognized the same girl who had big hopes and expectations when I saw her there. However, she had a grieving expression on her face that said something was clearly bothering her and she was quite sad.
When the bus came to pick me up at the Wangdue crossroads at noon, it turned around and began the initial drive to the eastern region of Bhutan. As soon as I got on the bus, I was surrounded by friends and strangers wearing the same orange outfit, which stands for a respectable and trusted citizen of His Majesty (the guardian of peace). I sat down on the bus' window side, and the entire trip to Rukubje was rarely quiet and also somewhat lonely.
I liked the really surreal atmosphere in Wangdue, and occasionally I liked the melodious song blasts from the bus.
 The modest restaurant on the Wangdue to Trongsa highway offered meals in the late afternoon. I was deeply appreciative to his majesty for providing all free educational resources and the necessary accommodations up till the destination. And each thinking merely increases my enthusiasm for greater education and a promising future. We awaited the arrival of the remaining trip dessups after the first ones were served. We currently have four buses worth of dessups hurriedly juggling one another.
As the sun began to set and the shadows grew thick and lengthy, we immediately continued traveling. Hopefully, I ran into a young woman who was quietly waiting for me with long beautiful hair bunned firmly inside a net. As soon as I met her, I had the impression that my loneliness  had immediately vanished and I was now entirely in her presence. I hopped on another bus and sat down next to her. I feel so open and light with her because she seems to be more direct and jovial than I anticipated her to be with me. Her presence simply gives me the vibes of one of my close friends.
Let me simply introduce her. Her name is Namgay Choden, and I basically just called her Namgay! Our ages and educational backgrounds are practically the same. Additionally, after a lengthy bus talk,  I learned more about her preferences, likes, and dislikes. What's more intriguing is that she's in love with a former classmate of mine. Our connection was deepened and our ability to laugh together as a result of learning more about her.
When we arrived at Trongsa, the heart of Bhutan, the dusk gave way to night. I was overjoyed to see the magnificent Dzong of Trongsa and the enormous Mangdechhu hydropower plant situated in the confined Trongsa valley. Unfortunately, I didn't appreciate it as much because the darkness obscured the Trongsa's stunning scenery, leaving me with nothing but the twinkling stars of night. Long momentum sleep was required to accomplish the nightlong task to put an end to our night at Bumthang.
<br><br>
<i>Epi-2 </i>
Yes! After the task was successfully done, we stopped in bumthang to rest up for the night.
As is customary at bumthang, the food was ready to be served. I found the entire location odd and unfamiliar. My favorite location, however, is Bumthang, and I have been yearning to go there. Even though I could only see the night scene, I was nevertheless happy. My happiest moment was simply being in Bumthang, and I hope to continue to stay there in the future. Once dinner was finished, we headed to our hotel in Chamkhar town. I'm hoping to witness a really clear day view of Bumthang, but I've already made a few memories there.
The only sound in the town was the cacophony of barking stray dogs, and it was rarely quiet. Because Dawa's final stop on his journey to recover from the awful illness known as manges was  Bumthang, I was reminded of the famous novel of Dawa Kota, which I had read in secondary school.
On the ninth of October, with half-dazed eyes from the night before, we started traveling again at dawn. It's understandable why everyone started to nod off as soon as we settled on the bus. I, too, fell asleep soundly and slept through the early morning until the light rose above the crest of the young mountains. When the skies cleared, we crossed Chamkhar and arrived in Chumey Valley. The valley was stunning and appeared so serene and modest. I see firsthand why everyone considers Bumthang to be Bhutan's equivalent of Switzerland.
We were ascending the Thrumshingla pass as we left the main bumthang valley. The drive was beautiful and melodious despite the hard road and the presence of more well-known individuals.
From thrumshingla to mongar and then from mongar to trashigang, our final stop, we have finished the entire voyage. Since this was my first visit to eastern Bhutan, I was unsure of how I would adjust to their customs and language because everything there appears strange and foreign to me. The majority of the time, sharchop is the language that is used, and Dzongkha is rarely used. To connect with others, I claimed to be familiar with sharchop and mostly nodded my head. I was made to feel downright stupid and realized how important it is to master several languages
.
We arrived at Yongphula for our last stop at 10 o'clock at night. There is a cool and melancholy vibe here. Oh, I should have said why we are in Eastern Bhutan. Ever since I first learned about Python in my 12th grade, I have had a desire for learning how to code. I therefore had the equally fortunate opportunity to be chosen for the DSP (dessung skilling program) at Yongphula for a month. I'm hoping that the entire coding learning process will give me new optimism and perspective on life.Thank you once more, Your Majesty, for providing us with all of these opportune opportunities. 
As usual, I was placed in a small dorm with Namgay and another new girl as soon as we arrived. We neatly placed our belongings in our room and got ample slumber. Just then, a young woman of average height who has blunt hair hanging over her face and a smile greets us, unintentionally causing our smile to curve in her direction. She was a part of our group, and now she shares in my joy. I adore their company so much, and despite our recent acquaintance, we felt as though we had known each other for a very long time.

<i>Episode-3</i>
The training officially began on the tenth day of October with a formal meeting in front of the OIC and all the coordinators. We received thorough training on the timetables and expectations that we must all follow. The first day of the session was not serious, as is common, and following the briefing, we were sent to our respective hostel.
For me, the first day of the course was a revitalizing experience. We three started spending time together, laughing and having fun. I had the impression that we had filled the entire institute.
The second day came with abundant hope and a fresh start for my depressing history.
I was concerned about my ability to adjust to the Yongphula region's tough environment, which included a chilling wind and intermittent light rain that lasted for over three days. The weather was dismal and somewhat cloudy. The damp clothing is hung outside as it dries in the freezing winds.
It was expected that I would be more flirty after the first three days, which were pretty dull. That evening as I hurried along, I came across a tall man who was tempting me with his mouth covered in unusual height. I didn't care because I was aware that all he was doing was making fun of me for his own amusement. I didn't turn to look at him as I passed him. I arrived at my dorm within the hour and changed out of my uniform so I could get a good night's sleep after a long day. The phone suddenly vibrates, signaling a telegram message from an unknown account. I dismissed the notification, and then a new one appeared. "Hello, Damnless! I saw you that evening!”
My desire to find out who sent the text message grew as a result of the message. I replied to the message, and despite the lengthy chat lasting until after midnight, I chose not to reveal the identity of the sender. As we kept contacting one another, it appeared as though I was playing a treasure hunt game. Once, we tried to locate a time to meet, but every time we tried, it fell through, and the day was wasted. Nevertheless, we continued to text each other and grew closer.
Finally, the following day arrived, and we made plans to meet up once the session was through for the day. I didn't really like how he insisted on me entering his classroom on my own rather than waiting for him to come get me. When we finally did meet that evening, I was genuinely taken aback by his amazing height. He had brown skin, a shaggy hairdo, and was almost six feet tall, making him the tallest boy in the institute. At first, I was terrified to approach him, and I could tell that he felt the same way. Once more, I couldn't do anything when I learned that he is also a sharshop and spends most of his time at Pemagatshel. We began to communicate more and get to know one another better. We went on a date in the hopes that it would deepen our relationship, but I was unable to love him back because I was aware that I cannot compel someone into my affections against their will. The longer we talked, the more I could see from his text that he didn't trust me.As a result, our relationship was only for fun and neither of us took it seriously.
Finally, the weekend arrived, and the three of us decided to visit Yongphulla Airport with some of our fellow students since it was everyone's one wish when they first arrived at Yongphulla Training Center. The neighboring Lhakhang, which is situated at the summit of Yongphulla Pass, was another destination on our itinerary. We wore matching dresses since it suited us so well and because Namgay, Yeshey, and I were very excited that day. My companion and I both wore stunning kiras and tegos, and I chose a Pangtse kira with a deep purple tego.
As soon as we left campus, we proceeded to a local temple to pray and prostrate, praying for blessings to fall upon us and for the improvement of other sentient beings who are typically in need like we are.
One of the main shrines in the neighborhood's places to worship and get blessings is the temple, which goes by the name of Yongphula Lhakhang. It was a wonderful occasion for us, and we captured it on camera to preserve the memories.
From the start of the day, everything seems wonderful and positive. We waited for another group of colleagues because we had already decided to go to Yongphula Hill, better known as the Yongphulla Airport Viewpoint.
The moment has come to put my damaged heart back together. When the squad arrives, a man of average height and intelligent outlooks is coming with them. His dark green coat hung over his shoulder, and he was dressed in joggers and a maroon t-shirt. The man was preoccupied conversing with a local monk, who was essentially serving as our tour guide and perhaps interpreting the religious texts. We were all following the monk in the chain.
The trek may be exhausting, but the beauty of the man truly renews every fiber of my being. I made every effort to be close to him and communicate with him normally, and over time, we developed a range of conversational topics. As we revealed more about one another and had some fun together, my heart began to feel considerably lighter. It was the first time in my life that I tried on a man I was crushing on, and I was able to speak to him with confidence as though we had been friends for a very long time.
My heart genuinely desired more time with him, but the trip seemed shorter than I had anticipated. We arrived at the mountain, our intended target, and took in Yongphula's genuine beauty. The view from the highest top of the valley was breathtaking, but everything felt weird. I could make out the magnificent Yongphulla airport and the lush, bare-grass meadow that was ringed with the enchanting music of nesting birds.The whole trip ended beautifully and we returned to the center.
We all gathered in the hall to rejoice and take in the gorgeous night as Diwali finally got closer. I happened to be sitting directly behind the man I met on the trip when my companions and I chose a seat in the middle of the crowd. When we look at one other, my heart frequently races with anxiety. He appeared to be very loud, yet his dapper appearance and identically resembling Misty Terrace's hair gave him an impression of coolness. He was speaking to my friends in a loud voice, and his accent made it clear to me that he, too, was the son of an eastern family.
I suddenly heard him say something that desperately made me chuckle.He became uncomfortable as Yeshey and I began to tease him. The lovely moment, however, has yet to begin because of our incredibly funny talk. Although I usually ignore him, my attention was caught on him.
Following that night, we began to graze wherever we came across one another, and I even reached out to a distant sight to see whether he was there. He gives off such a positive, humorous vibe that it breaks up any awkward pause and causes everyone to chuckle.
We began to see one other during our leisure time, exchange our thoughts, and make fun of one another. That strengthens our relationship and friendship. People started making fun of us and calling us "Singye and Galem," the storied couple who departed us a decade ago with a wonderful legacy of steadfast love and affection.Despite the disappointment that resulted from the rumors being circulated throughout the entire center, the heart continued to flourish and the smile continued to shine each night like a crooked moon.

It’s already December, the temperature has begun to drop. Between -1 and 7 degrees Celsius are considered normal. As the trainees' courses are finished, more join and continue to go. However, we still have a few more months until we will undoubtedly experience the bitterly cold Yongphula season. I missed my homeland of Punakha, where the winter is much better and the only time the dispersed family comes together, the friends go on holiday, and more importantly, the annual ritual happens.
I speak with my mother on the phone a lot; she is in her late 50s and a very enthusiastic learner. Despite not receiving an education throughout her formative years, she remains dedicated to exploring the Dzongkha and English alphabets. She is thus seen as a woman who has never attended school but yet learns, and despite this, everyone is proud of her for being able to readily recite prayers and read dzongkha script on par with literate people.
She speaks less on the phone and her every concern is if i am doing well and how my  learning progress is. She is a compassionate and thoughtful woman who doesn't disappoint easily; instead, she constantly promotes that everything that seems impossible is actually doable and just lets us go with the flow. Thus, despite the fact that they are lacking in many areas, I always feel fortunate to have such lovely mentors and support in my life.
Finally, National Day, which is just a week away, is approaching. Every course is instructed to create cultural items, and it's a really exciting time to commemorate the day that is observed on December 17 in particular. From that day forward, everything truly went as planned, and I started celebrating with my colleagues. In addition, I'm happy to share that one of the boys in his early 20s joined us, increasing the size of our group. Jordhan is the lone individual that always sticks by our side. He is such a kind person with good height and decent behavior that we might even say he is the center's most attractive man, both physically and ethically.
Every night we stayed late to rehearse dance in class, and by the time it was ready to finally perform in front of an audience, our dance had become a spectacular performance.
With a loud cheer and a room full of applauding and whistles, we are addressing the crowd with pride. We appreciated each other's dances, and that particular day was extra great because I was with my friends and because my crush was seated right next to me. We worked together to make the day enjoyable. It was also a wonderful opportunity to pay tribute to His Majesty, hear from him, and express gratitude for all he had done to bring Bhutan together as a one country.
After knowing that my childhood buddy and brother will be hanging out with us while taking a course here, I feel as though the best is yet to come on this beautiful stay. My home will be sending me parcels, which makes me even happier.
